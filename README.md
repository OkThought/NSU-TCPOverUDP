# TCPOverUDP

Task 4 of the course 'Networking Technologies' at NSU. 

## Description

The task is to implement our own version of TCP Socket and ServerSocket with appropriate operations using UDP.
So that our previous task 'TCPTransfer' would work with these Socket and ServerSocket as though nothing had changed.
